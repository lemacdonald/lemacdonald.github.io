        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I completed my double bachelors in mathematics and physics at the UoW in 2015. I was awarded First Class Honours and a PhD in pure mathematics by UoW in 2015 and 2019 respectively under the supervision of Adam Rennie. For my PhD thesis, on the noncommutative geometry of foliated manifolds, I was awarded the Best Thesis Award in the Faculty of Engineering and Information Sciences. I subsequently undertook a 4 month postdoc at the Australian National University and a 12 month postdoc at the University of Adelaide, both in pure mathematics, where I continued my research into the topology and geometry of foliated manifolds, culminating in the construction of a Chern-Weil theory for singular foliations.
