        <p>Postdoctoral researcher, <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>, Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I completed my double bachelors in mathematics and physics at the <a href="https://www.uow.edu.au/">University of Wollongong (UoW)</a> in 2015. I was awarded First Class Honours and a PhD in pure mathematics by UoW in 2015 and 2019 respectively under the supervision of Adam Rennie. For my Honours thesis, on the equivariant Atiyah-Singer index theorem, I was awarded the University Medal. For my PhD thesis, on the noncommutative geometry of foliated manifolds, I was awarded the Best Thesis Award in the Faculty of Engineering and Information Sciences.</p>

        <p>I subsequently undertook a 4-month postdoc at the <a href="https://www.anu.edu.au/">Australian National University</a> and a 12-month postdoc at the <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/">University of Adelaide</a>, both in pure mathematics, under the mentorship of Alan Carey and Mathai Varghese respectively. During this time, I continued my research into the topology and geometry of foliated manifolds, culminating in the systematisation of the construction of holonomy groupoids for foliations and the construction of a Chern-Weil theory for singular foliations.</p>

        <p>In May 2021, I joined the <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/">Australian Institute for Machine Learning</a> as a member of Simon Lucey's research group. Over the following two years I developed a research program tackling theoretical aspects of deep learning including equivariance, optimization, and generalization. My work has been published at conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, and CVPR.</p>

        <p>As of July 2023, I am continuing my research as a joint member of Rene Vidal's deep learning theory research group and the <a href="https://www.minds.jhu.edu/">Mathematical Institute for Data Science</a> at Johns Hopkins University. My current research centers on the construction of general theoretical foundations for deep learning which can explain the miraculous empirical performance of deep learning models.</p>

        <p>I spend my spare time exploring Baltimore with my partner and reading philosophy, especially the work of Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel.</p>
